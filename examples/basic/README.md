# Basic Example

A basic example demonstrating the usage of `rollup-plugin-ast-explorer`.

## Usage

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run in watch mode
pnpm dev

# Build once
pnpm build
```

The plugin will start a server at `http://localhost:4178` where you can explore the AST of the modules being bundled.
